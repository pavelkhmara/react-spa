# React Fundamentals Project

This project was developed step by step while learning **React.js** from scratch.  
It implements the most common functionality found in modern applications: components, routing, forms, state management, API calls, and reusable UI elements ‚Äî all styled with responsive, modern CSS.

## üìö Topics Covered

### Basics
- **Introduction & Theory**: Core React concepts and project setup with Create React App.
- **JSX**: Writing UI code inside JavaScript.
- **App Component & State**: Using `useState` to manage component state.
- **Controlled Input**: Handling input values in React.
- **First Functional Component** and **First Class Component**.
- **Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect` basics.

### Styling
- Using **CSS classes** and **modules** for scoped styling.
- Custom **UI Library**: reusable components with `props.children`.
- Preventing page reload on form submit.
- **Ref & Uncontrolled Components**: Using `useRef` to access DOM elements.
- **React DevTools**: debugging React apps in the browser.

### Components & Data
- **Props**: passing arguments to components.
- **Lists & Keys**: rendering arrays of objects.
- **Form to create posts**: controlled vs uncontrolled forms.
- **Data exchange**: parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication.
- **Conditional Rendering**.

### Features
- **Sorting & Filtering**: with dropdowns and search.
- **Memoization**: optimizing with `useMemo`.
- **Modal Windows**: reusable UI modal component.
- **Animations**: with `react-transition-group`.
- **Decomposition & Custom Hooks**.
- **Server Communication**: fetching posts via Axios.
- **Lifecycle & Effects**: `useEffect`.
- **API Service (PostService)**.
- **Loading Indicators** and custom **Loader Component**.
- **Custom Hook `useFetching`**: data fetching with error handling.
- **Pagination**: client-side and dynamic infinite scrolling with `useObserver`.

### Routing & Navigation
- **React Router**: navigation with `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch`, `Redirect`.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: `useHistory`, `useParams`.
- **Comments Loading** for individual posts.
- **Improved Navigation**: private and public routes.
- **Global State with Context**: `useContext` for user authentication.
